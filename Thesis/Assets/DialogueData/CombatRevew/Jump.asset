  - 'I don''t think I can jump over the river. You can probably tell I''ve got short
    legs! The river''s just too wide for me. '

    always end up falling in and getting washed downstream. Trust me, those are some
    painful memories. '
  - 'If you find another way for me to get across, let me know. I''ll keep looking
    for a way too. '
