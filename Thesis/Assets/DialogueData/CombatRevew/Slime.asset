  dialogue:
  - What? Your weapon's not hurting the slimes? That's weird. It looks pretty cool
    and powerful to me...
  - "You saw shields pop up when you tried to hit them? Strange... I\u2019m not seeing
    that on my end."
  - "Wait, could it be because of that magic fountain in the middle? I heard those
    are powered by pieces of the Stone of Magic. Maybe that\u2019s how the Demon
    King is boosting his monster army."
  - "We\u2019ve gotta take down that machine! But first, we need to figure out a
    way to get there."
  - "No worries, though. My laser gun\u2019s working just fine. I\u2019ll handle
    the slimes for now. I\u2019ve got your back!"
